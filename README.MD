# Google Voice Chrome Extension Redesign

Redesigned Google Voice extension to take on material design principles as well as the new Google Voice logo, coloring, and styling.

This project was just for fun and my own use. CSS is a ton of fun and it was a personal experiment for me to unpack and modify a Chrome extension.

Note: this is a work in progress and I didn't go into a lot of detail so the code is very messy and not characteristic of my typical work. It was rough and dirty coding just for my own amusement.

### [Google](https://google.com) and the [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) team.
This is just a lot of restyling of the extension they created. I'm just a major Google fanboy and dye-hard user of their products (I've used Google Voice as my only phone number since 2008)!

### [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2250163/how-do-i-directly-modify-a-google-chrome-extension-file-crx)
Specifically [jdavis]() & [heatfanjohn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1411277/heatfanjohn) for their helpful information about Chrome extensions.
